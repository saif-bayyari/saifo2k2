Hi! I'm Saif Bayyari. I'm a 21 year old college student pursuing a cybersecurity degree and a software development focus in Information Technology.

I am interested in getting my first computer programming job, preferably an internship/co-op in January 2024.

I'm looking to collaborate on any mobile app, game, or web development projects in the C# or Python languages.
