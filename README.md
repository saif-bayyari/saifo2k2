Hi! I'm Saif Bayyari. I'm a 20 year old college student pursuing a cybersecurity degree.

I am interested in getting my first computer programming job, preferably an internship/co-op in January 2023.

I'm looking to collaborate on any mobile app, game, or web development projects in the C# or Python languages.

I'm currently learning .NET 6 Web Application development and Lua scripting!
